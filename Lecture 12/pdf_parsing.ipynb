Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be impacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing and plans.\\n\\n# INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\\n\\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\\n\\n# REGULATION\\n\\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix. This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the extent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\\n\\n# HUMAN CAPITAL\\n\\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 13,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,000 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,000 (15%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 500 (4%) in Latin America and 1,500 (12%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year. We believe a critical component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our associates to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of excellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. We empower all of our employees so that they can have significant impact and input into decision-making; each employee has a high degree of freedom and power to make the decisions and take actions in the best interest of the company in carrying out their role. In return, our employees are responsible and accountable for those decisions and actions. With this approach, we believe we are a more flexible, fun, stimulating, creative, collaborative and successful organization.\\n\\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it’s important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by training our recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\\n\\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer programs, such as seminars and lectures, that are designed to equip our leaders (officers, VPs, people managers and director and senior manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic goals. We have built a portfolio of programs under three foundational pillars - great company, great leaders, and great human beings - which we believe support our current and future success. We also offer programs and workshops to provide skills and coaching to employees on a variety of topics, such as leading and inspiring.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='bed8f1de-da1e-4b4b-a258-64fd69a81cab', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'report.pdf', 'file_name': 'report.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1073470, 'creation_date': '2024-12-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-12-19'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='# Table of Contents\\n\\nteams. We believe this focus helps our employees grow as leaders and well-rounded individuals, and better positions Netflix to operate our global business of providing compelling content to entertain the world.\\n\\nWe aim to generally pay our employees at the top of their personal market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee\\'s individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender (globally) and race (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\\n\\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\\n\\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.\\n\\n# OTHER INFORMATION\\n\\nWe maintain a website at www.netflix.com.

Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. In addition, new technological developments, including the development and use of generative artificial intelligence, are rapidly evolving. If our competitors gain an advantage by using such technologies, our ability to compete effectively and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Piracy also threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. In light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth, and our efforts to prevent that growth may be insufficient.

To the extent our content, in particular, our original programming, is perceived as low quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the extent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect retaliatory action or behavior, including being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations. We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, to the extent our response to government action or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. There is an increasing focus from regulators, investors, members and other stakeholders on environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters, both in the United States and internationally, including the adoption of new disclosure and regulatory frameworks. To the extent the content we distribute and the manner in which we produce content creates ESG related concerns, our reputation may be harmed.\\n\\nOur business could be adversely impacted by costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments.\\n\\nFrom time to time, we acquire or invest in businesses, content, and technologies that support our business. The risks associated with such acquisitions or investments (some of which may be unforeseen) include the difficulty of integrating solutions, operations, and personnel; inheriting liabilities and exposure to litigation; failure to realize anticipated benefits and expected synergies; and diversion of management’s time and attention, among other acquisition-related risks.\\n\\nWe may not be successful in overcoming such risks, and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business. In addition, if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated. Acquisitions and investments may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. These fluctuations could arise from transaction-related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments, and could negatively impact our financial results.\\n\\nWe rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.\\n\\nWe currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players, TV set-top boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available through the TV set-top boxes of these service providers, some of which compete directly with us or have investments in competing streaming content providers. In many instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers services or products in connection with offering our service. If partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to watch, for example through multi-service discovery interfaces, our service may be adversely impacted. We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with existing partners and to increase our capability to stream TV series and films and offer games to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in maintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to delivering our streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.\\n\\nOur agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a number of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree of accessibility and prominence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be responsible for the devices’ performance, the connection between these devices and our service may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward us and such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming functionality may require that partners update their devices, or may lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy devices.

Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules, regulations, and industry standards, including data storage requirements, additional authentication requirements for certain payment methods, and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, changes to rules, regulations or industry standards concerning payments, loss of payment partners and/or disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems, partner systems or payment products, including products we use to update payment information, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operations could be adversely impacted. In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf. If these third parties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to transition subscribers or otherwise find alternative methods of collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of payment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of our service. If we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines, our card approval rate may be impacted and we may be subject to additional card authentication requirements.

The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\\n\\nMusic and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations (“CMOs”) and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to expose us to greater distribution expenses in certain markets.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='cd0c941d-710b-4655-8dd0-89ee98fa35fc', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'report.pdf', 'file_name': 'report.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1073470, 'creation_date': '2024-12-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-12-19'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='# Table of Contents\\n\\nIf our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\\n\\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='54522f10-de2d-4fdc-a7c0-997a487bf6cd', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'report.pdf', 'file_name': 'report.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1073470, 'creation_date': '2024-12-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-12-19'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='# Table of Contents\\n\\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, or insider threats, as well as misconfigurations in information systems, networks, software or hardware, and similar disruptions or errors. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. We and many of the third parties we work with rely on open source software and libraries that are integrated into a variety of applications, tools and systems, which may increase our exposure to vulnerabilities. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees, vendors, partners, or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. However, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent unauthorized access or address all cybersecurity incidents that occur. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) have been and may continue to be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. We do not carry insurance to cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members and adversely affect our business and results of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider. In addition, we utilize third-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party content delivery networks to help us stream TV series, documentaries and feature films and offer games in high volume to Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or our third-party “cloud” computing or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference, could adversely impact the experience of our members.\\n\\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\\n\\nAmazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a \"cloud\" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. While the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service, although if it were to do so it could harm our business.\\n\\nIf the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\\n\\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business.

For example, we have built and deployed our own content-delivery network (“CDN”). To the extent Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) do not interconnect with our CDN or charge us to access their networks, or if we experience difficulties in our CDN’s operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected.

We rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and our member acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and either charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.\\n\\nMost network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such, many network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe that consumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide preferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively impacted. The extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.\\n\\n# Risks Related to Privacy\\n\\nPrivacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage member personal information and disclosure of member personal information could adversely impact our business and reputation.\\n\\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition, merchandising our service to our members and our ad-supported subscription plan, we collect and utilize information supplied by our members, which may include personal information and other data.

We also enter into multi-year commitments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these productions such as non-cancelable commitments under talent agreements. The payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments, to the extent estimable under accounting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II, Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if business performance does not meet our expectations, our margins may be adversely impacted. Further, we may be unable to react to any reduction in our cash flows from operations, including those caused by a downturn in the economy, by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not fund the production of such content. To the extent membership and/or revenue growth do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements.

As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $7.0 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic, political, regulatory and other risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:\\n\\n- the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences;\\n- difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\\n- political or social unrest, global hostilities, and economic instability;\\n- compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;\\n- difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions, including local ownership requirements for streaming content providers;\\n- regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content or increased operating costs in the applicable jurisdiction;\\n- foreign intellectual property laws, such as the EU copyright directive, or changes to such laws, among other issues, may impact the economics of creating or distributing content, anti-piracy efforts, or our ability to protect or exploit intellectual property rights;\\n- adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is uncertain;\\n- fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which have and may continue to impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk, and while we use derivative instruments to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, the use of such hedging activities may not be effective in offsetting an adverse financial impact and may introduce or heighten counterparty risk;\\n- rates of inflation;\\n- profit repatriation, currency control regulations and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;\\n- differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;\\n- new and different sources of competition;', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='fb2f226d-ea9e-45b0-ae0a-57b990faf5a0', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'report.pdf', 'file_name': 'report.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1073470, 'creation_date': '2024-12-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-12-19'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='# Table of Contents\\n\\n- censorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment, brand tarnishment or dissatisfaction with our service;\\n- low usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices;\\n- different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization and/or restrictions on data export, and local ownership requirements;\\n- availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion;\\n- differing laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy;\\n- negative impacts from trade disputes; and\\n- implementation of regulations designed to stimulate the local production of film and TV series in order to promote and preserve local culture and economic activity, including local content quotas, investment obligations, and levies to support local film funds. For example, the European Union revised its Audio Visual Media Services Directive in 2018 to require that European works comprise at least thirty percent (30%) of media service providers’ catalogs, and to require prominence of those works.\\n\\nThese and other factors may cause us to adjust our business plans, including expanding or ceasing certain operations in certain countries, and the execution of our strategies. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results of our operations.\\n\\n# We are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\\n\\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred taxes and other tax liabilities and receivables, and in evaluating our tax positions and other tax attributes on a worldwide basis. We are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the IRS, state, local, and foreign tax authorities, some of whom are challenging our tax positions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes. If the ultimate determination of income and other tax liabilities differ from the amounts recorded or accrued, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\\n\\nTax laws are regularly being re-examined and evaluated globally. New laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for financial statement purposes in the quarter or year that they become applicable. Tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies and we have tax audits pending in several jurisdictions. The U.S. federal and state governments, countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do business. If U.S. or other tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge how or where our profits are currently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\\n\\n# Risks Related to Human Resources\\n\\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees, and the failure to maintain and improve our company culture may adversely affect our business.\\n\\nWe rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, our Executive Chairman, Reed Hastings, members of our executive team and other key employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development, technical, creative and other personnel. If we experience high executive turnover, fail to adapt our business practices to industry expectations, fail to implement succession plans for key employees, encounter difficulties associated with the transition of members of our management team, are not successful in recruiting new personnel or in retaining and motivating existing personnel, in instilling our culture in new employees, or maintaining and improving our culture as we grow, our operations may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\\n\\nLabor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.\\n\\nWe and our partners, suppliers, and vendors engage writers, directors, actors, other talent, trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements in the motion picture industry, both in the U.S. and internationally. Expiring collective bargaining agreements may be renewed on terms that are unfavorable to us. If expiring collective bargaining agreements cannot be renewed, affected unions have, and could in the future, take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages.

Collective bargaining agreements with the I.A.T.S.E. representing technicians and “behind the camera” crews as well as contracts with Teamster unions expire in mid-2024. The WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes as well as the recent resurgence of organized labor in the United States may lead those workers to strike. Such work stoppages have resulted, and may in the future result, in halted productions and delays in our ability to provide new content to our members. Such actions, as well as higher costs or operating complexities in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production, added costs or by reducing profit margins, and our ability to provide new content to our members could likewise be delayed or dropped.\\n\\n# Risks Related to Our Stock Ownership\\n\\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable, although we have announced plans to modify some of these provisions over time.\\n\\nOur charter documents in their current form may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because they:\\n\\nauthorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\\nprovide for a classified board of', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='21c79548-f3fe-4f50-a86b-c6b711170213', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'report.pdf', 'file_name': 'report.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1073470, 'creation_date': '2024-12-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-12-19'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='# Table of Contents\\n\\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Also, predicting consumer adoption of various pricing strategies, such as the ad-supported subscription plan or efforts to limit multi-household usage, and new revenue streams, such as advertising revenue, is inherently difficult given the lack of operating history with respect to such offerings, and actual results may differ significantly from the expectations of our management, securities analysts or investors. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the content amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series, documentary or feature film based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing or recognition of content amortization. If we revise such estimates it could result in greater in-period expenses, which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price. Further, events outside of our control may cause actual results to differ from our forecast.\\n\\n# Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\\n\\nNone.\\n\\n# Item 1C. Cybersecurity\\n\\nWe have an enterprise-wide information security program designed to identify, protect, detect and respond to and manage reasonably foreseeable cybersecurity risks and threats. To protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats, we use various security tools that help prevent, identify, escalate, investigate, resolve and recover from identified vulnerabilities and security incidents in a timely manner. These include, but are not limited to, internal reporting, monitoring and detection tools, and a bug bounty program to allow security researchers to assist us in identifying vulnerabilities in our products before they are exploited by malicious threat actors. We also maintain a third party security program to identify, prioritize, assess, mitigate and remediate third party risks; however, we rely on the third parties we use to implement security programs commensurate with their risk, and we cannot ensure in all circumstances that their efforts will be successful.\\n\\nWe regularly assess risks from cybersecurity and technology threats and monitor our information systems for potential vulnerabilities. We use a widely-adopted risk quantification model to identify, measure and prioritize cybersecurity and technology risks and develop related security controls and safeguards. We conduct regular reviews and tests of our information security program and also leverage audits by our internal audit team, tabletop exercises, penetration and vulnerability testing, red team exercises, simulations, and other exercises to evaluate the effectiveness of our information security program and improve our security measures and planning. We also engage an external auditor to conduct an annual payment card industry data security standard review of our security controls protecting payment information, as well as third-party penetration testing of our cardholder environment and related systems. The results of these assessments are reported to the Audit Committee.\\n\\nOur systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property, and we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets. However, to date these incidents have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members and adversely affect our business and results of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Risk Factors - Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized access, disclosure or destruction of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business.\"\\n\\nThe Vice President of Security and Privacy Engineering leads our global information security organization responsible for overseeing the Netflix information security program.

We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of December 31, 2023, pricing on our paid plans ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1 to $28 per month, and pricing on our extra member sub accounts ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2 to $8 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations.\\n\\nWe also earn revenue from advertisements presented on our streaming service, consumer products and various other sources. Revenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not material for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\\n\\n|Year Ended December 31|2023|2022|2021|2023 vs. 2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Streaming revenues|$ 33,640,458|$ 31,469,852|$ 29,515,496|$ 2,170,606|', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='5bed766b-af3a-4612-bb85-90c3a5ab09fe', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'report.pdf', 'file_name': 'report.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1073470, 'creation_date': '2024-12-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-12-19'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='# Table of Contents\\n\\nStreaming revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 7% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the 8% growth in average paying memberships, partially offset by a 1% decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership. The decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership was primarily due to changes in plan mix, higher membership growth in regions with lower average monthly revenue per paying membership, partially offset by limited price increases. Additionally, streaming revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were further impacted by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\\n\\nThe following tables summarize streaming revenue and other streaming membership information by region for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\\n\\n# United States and Canada (UCAN)\\n\\n|As of/Year Ended December 31|2023|2022|2021|Change|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Revenues|$14,873,783|$14,084,643|$12,972,100|$789,140 (6%)|\\n|Paid net membership additions (losses)|5,832|(919)|1,279|6,751 (735%)|\\n|Paid memberships at end of period (1)|80,128|74,296|75,215|5,832 (8%)|\\n|Average paying memberships|76,126|74,001|74,234|2,125 (3%)|\\n|Average monthly revenue per paying membership|$16.28|$15.86|$14.56|$0.42 (3%)|\\n|Constant currency change (2)| | | | |\\n\\n# Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)\\n\\n|As of/Year Ended December 31|2023|2022|2021|Change|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Revenues|$10,556,487|$9,745,015|$9,699,819|$811,472 (8%)|\\n|Paid net membership additions|12,084|2,693|7,338|9,391 (349%)|\\n|Paid memberships at end of period (1)|88,813|76,729|74,036|12,084 (16%)|\\n|Average paying memberships|80,928|73,904|69,518|7,024 (10%)|\\n|Average monthly revenue per paying membership|$10.87|$10.99|$11.63|($0.12) (-1%)|\\n|Constant currency change (2)| | | | |\\n\\n# Latin America (LATAM)\\n\\n|As of/Year Ended December 31|2023|2022|2021|Change|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Revenues|$4,446,461|$4,069,973|$3,576,976|$376,488 (9%)|\\n|Paid net membership additions|4,298|1,738|2,424|2,560 (147%)|\\n|Paid memberships at end of period (1)|45,997|41,699|39,961|4,298 (10%)|\\n|Average paying memberships|42,802|40,000|38,573|2,802 (7%)|\\n|Average monthly revenue per paying membership|$8.66|$8.48|$7.73|$0.18 (2%)|\\n|Constant currency change (2)| | | | |\\n\\n# Asia-Pacific (APAC)\\n\\n22', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='db4c732a-de94-40e2-a90b-bded46c98fa5', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'report.pdf', 'file_name': 'report.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1073470, 'creation_date': '2024-12-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-12-19'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='# Table of Contents\\n\\n# As of/Year Ended December 31\\n\\n| |2023|2022|2021|2023 vs. 2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Revenues|$3,763,727|$3,570,221|$3,266,601|$193,506 (5%)|\\n|Paid net membership additions|7,315|5,391|7,140|1,924 (36%)|\\n|Paid memberships at end of period (1)|45,338|38,023|32,632|7,315 (19%)|\\n|Average paying memberships|41,033|35,019|28,461|6,014 (17%)|\\n|Average monthly revenue per paying membership|$7.64|$8.50|$9.56|($0.86) (10%)|\\n|Constant currency change (2)| | | | |\\n\\n(1) A paid membership (also referred to as a paid subscription) is defined as a membership that has the right to receive Netflix service following sign-up and a method of payment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions that may be offered by the Company to new or rejoining members. Certain members have the option to add extra member sub accounts. These extra member sub accounts are not included in paid memberships. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company’s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.\\n\\n(2) We believe the non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency revenue is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership absent foreign currency fluctuations. However, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership, we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our revenues would have been approximately $597 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December 31, 2022.\\n\\n# Cost of Revenues\\n\\nAmortization of content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. Expenses directly associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content (such as payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other related personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs directly incurred in making our content available to members.\\n\\n# Year Ended December 31\\n\\n| |2023|2022|2021|2023 vs. 2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Cost of revenues|$19,715,368|$19,168,285|$17,332,683|$547,083 (3%)|\\n|As a percentage of revenues|58%|61%|58%| |\\n\\nThe increase in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was due to a $171 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new content, coupled with a $376 million increase in other cost of revenues primarily due to an increase in expenses directly associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content.\\n\\n# Marketing\\n\\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to our marketing and advertising sales partners, including consumer electronics (\"CE\") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), mobile operators and ISPs.

The amount of principal and interest due in the next twelve months is $1,077 million. The amount of principal and interest due beyond the next twelve months is $16,662 million. As of December 31, 2023, no amounts had been borrowed under our $1 billion Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nWe anticipate that our future capital needs from the debt market will be more limited compared to prior years. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose or need, including for potential strategic acquisitions and investments, will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\\n\\nIn March 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration date, and in September 2023, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $10 billion, also with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 14,513,790 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $6,045 million. As of December 31, 2023, $8.4 billion remains available for repurchases.\\n\\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related costs, as well as strategic acquisitions and investments. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly invest in global content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\\n\\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations. As of December 31, 2023, the expected timing of those payments are as follows:\\n\\n|Contractual obligations (in thousands)|Total|Next 12 Months|Beyond 12 Months|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Content obligations (1)|$21,713,349|$10,328,923|$11,384,426|\\n|Debt (2)|$17,739,159|$1,077,261|$16,661,898|\\n|Operating lease obligations (3)|$3,088,899|$513,506|$2,575,393|\\n|Total|$42,541,407|$11,919,690|$30,621,717|\\n\\n(1) As of December 31, 2023, content obligations were comprised of $4.5 billion included in \"Current content liabilities\" and $2.6 billion of \"Non-current content liabilities\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $14.6 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='cbba2192-3653-4ac7-969b-b610ec282d08', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'report.pdf', 'file_name': 'report.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1073470, 'creation_date': '2024-12-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-12-19'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='# Table of Contents\\n\\nContent obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\\n\\n(2) Debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\\n\\n(3) Operating lease obligations are comprised of operating lease liabilities included in \"Accrued expenses and other liabilities\" and \"Other non-current liabilities\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, inclusive of imputed interest. Operating lease obligations also include additional obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not meet the criteria for recognition. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has additional operating leases for real estate that have not yet commenced of $343 million which has been included above. See Note 5 Balance Sheet Components in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding leases.\\n\\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2023, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $327 million, of which $221 million was classified in “Other non-current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.\\n\\n# Free Cash Flow\\n\\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\\n\\nIn assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the major recurring differences are the timing impact between content payments and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, non-cash remeasurement gain/loss on our euro-denominated debt, excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation, and other working capital differences. Working capital differences primarily include deferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt.

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by a decrease in payments for content assets, coupled with a $916 million or 20% increase in net income and favorable changes in working capital. The payments for content assets decreased $3,519 million, from $16,660 million to $13,140 million, or 21%.\\n\\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities increased $2,618 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 to $542 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities is primarily due to proceeds from the maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases, and there being no acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to acquisitions for an aggregate amount of $757 million in the year ended December 31, 2022.\\n\\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $5,287 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 to $5,951 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in net cash used in financing activities is primarily due to repurchases of common stock for an aggregate amount of $6,045 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to no repurchases of common stock in the year ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by the absence of debt maturities in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the repayment upon maturity of the $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.500% Senior Notes in February 2022.\\n\\nFree cash flow was $1,518 million higher than net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to $1,057 million of amortization expense exceeding cash payments for content assets, $339 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, $176 million of non-cash remeasurement loss on our euro-denominated debt, and $47 million in other favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $101 million of property and equipment purchases exceeding depreciation expense.\\n\\n# Indemnifications\\n\\nThe information set forth under Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\\n\\n# Critical Accounting Estimates\\n\\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='dc9e8cde-587c-4a5d-88a7-18ad610664c4', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'report.pdf', 'file_name': 'report.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1073470, 'creation_date': '2024-12-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-12-19'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='# Table of Contents\\n\\nafter its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\\n\\nIn the normal course of business, we, or a third-party producing content on our behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on our service. Upon a title’s launch, any amounts we are eligible for through qualified production spend but have not received, are recognized in “Other current assets” or “Other non-current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets (presented in “Content assets, net”) and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in “Cost of revenues”) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\n\\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\\n\\n# Income Taxes\\n\\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.

Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 57% of revenue and 28% of operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, with our largest exposures being the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, and the Mexican peso.\\n\\nAccordingly, volatility in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our revenues would have been approximately $597 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those in the same period of 2022. See Part II, Item 7, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency.\\n\\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues occurring in January 2024 and beyond from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI\") and reclassify the amounts into “Revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the U.S dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $958 million lower. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in earnings.\\n\\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, we also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted and firmly committed U.S. dollar-equivalent transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets occurring in January 2024 and beyond from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into “Cost of Revenues” to offset the hedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. If the U.S dollar strengthened by 10% as of December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $71 million lower. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying exposures when recognized in earnings.\\n\\nWe have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a $293 million foreign exchange loss primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and content liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies.\\n\\nIn addition, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as disclosed on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the year ended December 31, 2023 was an increase of $83 million.\\n\\n# Item 8.

In our opinion, Netflix, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\\n\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated January 26, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\n\\n# Basis for Opinion\\n\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\n\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\n\\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\n\\n# Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\n\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\n\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\n\\nSan Jose, California\\n\\nJanuary 26, 2024\\n\\n32', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='9f2a0f97-c2c3-4650-a9f2-1cf741db2a03', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'report.pdf', 'file_name': 'report.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1073470, 'creation_date': '2024-12-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-12-19'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='# Table of Contents\\n\\n# Item 9B.

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company’s Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.\\n\\n# How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\\n\\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management’s controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate.\\n\\nTo test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management’s assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions.\\n\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\n\\nWe have

The Company is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with over 260 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages.

The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\\n\\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as “Content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\\n\\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. The Company\\'s estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\\n\\nIn the normal course of business, the Company, or a third-party producing content on the Company\\'s behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on the Company’s service. Upon a title’s launch, any amounts the Company is eligible for through qualified production spend but has not received, are recognized in “Other current assets” or “Other non-current assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of the Company’s content assets (presented in “Content assets, net”) and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in “Cost of revenues”) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances.

The Company has entered into various short-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less. These leases are not recorded on the Company\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets. All operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

A portion of the outstanding Notes is denominated in foreign currency (comprised of €5,170 million) and is remeasured into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date (with remeasurement loss totaling $176 million for the year ended December 31, 2023).\\n\\nThe following table provides a summary of the Company\\'s outstanding debt and the fair values based on quoted market prices in less active markets as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\\n\\n| |Principal Amount at Par| | | |Level 2 Fair Value as of| | | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022|Issuance Date|Maturity|December 31, 2023|December 31, 2022| | | | |\\n|5.750% Senior Notes|$400|$400|February 2014|March 2024|$400|$404| | | |\\n|5.875% Senior Notes|$800|$800|February 2015|February 2025|$807|$811| | | |\\n|3.000% Senior Notes (1)|$519|$503|April 2020|June 2025|$516|$495| | | |\\n|3.625% Senior Notes|$500|$500|April 2020|June 2025|$491|$479| | | |\\n|4.375% Senior Notes|$1,000|$1,000|October 2016|November 2026|$996|$980| | | |\\n|3.625% Senior Notes (1)|$1,434|$1,391|May 2017|May 2027|$1,454|$1,338| | | |\\n|4.875% Senior Notes|$1,600|$1,600|October 2017|April 2028|$1,621|$1,557| | | |\\n|5.875% Senior Notes|$1,900|$1,900|April 2018|November 2028|$2,009|$1,930| | | |\\n|4.625% Senior Notes (1)|$1,215|$1,177|October 2018|May 2029|$1,300|$1,151| | | |\\n|6.375% Senior Notes|$800|$800|October 2018|May 2029|$872|$830| | | |\\n|3.875% Senior Notes (1)|$1,325|$1,284|April 2019|November 2029|$1,372|$1,201| | | |\\n|5.375% Senior Notes|$900|$900|April 2019|November 2029|$931|$885| | | |\\n|3.625% Senior Notes (1)|$1,215|$1,177|October 2019|June 2030|$1,237|$1,078| | | |\\n|4.875% Senior Notes|$1,000|$1,000|October 2019|June 2030|$1,012|$944| | | |\\n|$14,608|$14,432| | | | | | | | |\\n| |$15,018|$14,083| | | | | | | |\\n\\n(1) The following Senior Notes have a principal amount denominated in euro: 3.000% Senior Notes for €470 million, 3.625% Senior Notes for €1,300 million, 4.625% Senior Notes for €1,100 million, 3.875% Senior Notes for €1,200 million, and 3.625% Senior Notes for €1,100 million.\\n\\nEach of the Notes are repayable in whole or in part upon the occurrence of a change of control, at the option of the holders, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal plus accrued interest.

Derivative Financial Instruments\\n\\nIn the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risk related to its ongoing business operations with the primary objective of reducing operating income and cash flow volatility associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.\\n\\n# Legal Proceedings\\n\\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\\n\\nThe Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\\n\\n# Non-Income Taxes\\n\\nThe Company is routinely under audit by various tax authorities with regard to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to our revenue in certain jurisdictions. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\\n\\nSimilar to other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the Company is involved in a number of matters with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments. Although the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these matters, there is inherent complexity and uncertainty with respect to these matters, and the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. The current potential exposure with respect to the various issues with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments is estimated to be approximately $300 million, which is expected to increase over time.\\n\\n# Guarantees—Indemnification Obligations\\n\\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='cb71fd0d-3f33-4310-8d96-a10fb2f854b8', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'report.pdf', 'file_name': 'report.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1073470, 'creation_date': '2024-12-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-12-19'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='# Table of Contents\\n\\nthem against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers.

Stock options granted to certain named executive officers vest on the one-year anniversary of the grant date, subject to the employee’s continuous employment or service with the Company through the vesting date. The following table summarizes the assumptions used to value option grants using the lattice-binomial model and the valuation data:\\n\\n| |Year Ended December 31,|2023|2022|2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Dividend yield| |— %|— %|— %|\\n|Expected volatility| |40% - 46%|38% - 52%|34% - 41%|\\n|Risk-free interest rate| |3.57% - 4.56%|1.71% - 3.79%|1.08% - 1.62%|\\n|Suboptimal exercise factor| |4.22 - 4.30|4.71 - 4.82|3.81 - 3.98|\\n\\nValuation data:\\n\\n|Weighted-average fair value (per share)|$ 211.27|$ 155.88|$ 259.01|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Total stock-based compensation expense (in thousands)|339,368|575,452|403,220|\\n|Total income tax impact on provision (in thousands)|61,588|127,289|89,642|\\n\\nThe Company considers several factors in determining the suboptimal exercise factor, including the historical and estimated option exercise behavior. The Company calculates expected volatility based solely on implied volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its common stock.\\n\\nIn valuing shares issued under the Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are generally fully vested upon grant date.\\n\\nThe total fair value of stock options that vested during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $311 million. The Company did not grant any stock options subject to vesting conditions in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2023, $26 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.45 years.\\n\\n# Stock Repurchases\\n\\nIn March 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of its common stock, with no expiration date, and in September 2023, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $10 billion, also with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities.

indefinitely, $838 million of state net operating loss carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2026, $19 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2033, and $421 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2024.\\n\\nIn evaluating its ability to realize the net deferred tax assets, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including its past operating results and the forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. As of December 31, 2023, the valuation allowance of $442 million was primarily related to California R&D tax credits, state net operating loss carryforwards, and foreign tax credits that the Company does not expect to realize.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2023, we have not provided for applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $52 million of our foreign undistributed earnings because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested. At December 31, 2023, we provided taxes and recorded a deferred tax liability on our undistributed foreign earnings for which we are not indefinitely reinvested.\\n\\nThe unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as “Other non-current liabilities” and a reduction of deferred tax assets which is classified as \"Other non-current assets\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $327 million and $227 million, respectively, of which $188 million and $155 million, respectively, if recognized, would favorably impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The aggregate changes in the Company’s total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are summarized as follows:\\n\\n| |As of December 31,|2023|2022|2021|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|(in thousands)|Balance at the beginning of the year|$ 226,977|$ 202,557|$ 140,124|\\n| |Increases related to tax positions taken during the current period|65,630|26,865|35,317|\\n| |Increases related to tax positions taken during prior periods|76,794|—|27,116|\\n| |Decreases related to tax positions taken during prior periods|(10,117)|(2,445)|—|\\n| |Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities|(32,179)|—|—|\\n| |Decreases related to expiration of statute of limitations|—|—|—|\\n| |Balance at the end of the year|$ 327,105|$ 226,977|$ 202,557|\\n\\nThe Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes and in “Other non-current liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $25 million, $2 million, and less than $1 million, respectively, of interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes. The amount of interest and penalties accrued at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $28 million and $3 million, respectively.\\n\\nThe Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for years 2016 through 2018 and is subject to examination for 2019 through 2022. The foreign and state tax returns for years 2016 through 2022 are subject to examination by various state and foreign jurisdictions. While the Company is in various stages of inquiry and examination with certain taxing authorities and we believe that our tax positions will more likely than not be sustained, it is nonetheless possible that future obligations related to these matters could arise. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from an examination.\\n\\nGiven the potential outcome of current examinations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made at this time.\\n\\n# 11. Employee Benefit Plan\\n\\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 80% of their annual salary through payroll deductions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at the discretion of the Board. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company’s matching contributions totaled $114 million, $102 million and $85 million, respectively.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='0b61d647-aefc-426f-8f28-ec9f934ae37a', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'report.pdf', 'file_name': 'report.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 1073470, 'creation_date': '2024-12-19', 'last_modified_date': '2024-12-19'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='# Table of Contents\\n\\n# Multiemployer Benefit Plans\\n\\nThe Company contributes to various multiemployer defined pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees. The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from single-employer plans such that (i) contributions made by the Company to the multiemployer pension plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in the multiemployer pension plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan; and (iii) if a company stops contributing to the multiemployer pension plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may become the obligation of the remaining participating employers. The Company also contributes to various other multiemployer benefit plans that provide health and welfare benefits to both active and retired participants.

Definitions\\n\\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:\\n\\n- a) “Company Group” means the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable.\\n- b) “Covered Compensation” means any Incentive-Based Compensation granted, vested or paid to a person who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for the Incentive-Based Compensation and that was Received (i) on or after the effective date of the applicable Nasdaq listing standards, (ii) after the person became an Executive Officer and (iii) at a time that the Company had a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association.\\n- c) “Effective Date” means October 27, 2023.\\n- d) “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of Covered Compensation granted, vested or paid to a person during the fiscal period when the applicable Financial Reporting Measure relating to such Covered Compensation was attained that exceeds the amount of Covered Compensation that otherwise would have been granted, vested or paid to the person had such amount been determined based on the applicable Restatement, computed without regard to any taxes paid (i.e., on a pre-tax basis). For Covered Compensation based on stock price or total stockholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in a Restatement, the Committee will determine the amount of such Covered Compensation that constitutes Erroneously Awarded Compensation, if any, based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the stock price or total stockholder return upon which the Covered Compensation was granted, vested or paid and the Committee shall maintain documentation of such determination and provide such documentation to the Nasdaq.\\n- e) “Exchange Act” means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\\n- f) “Executive Officer” means each “officer” of the Company as defined under Rule 16a-1(f) under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, which shall be deemed to include any individuals identified by the Company as executive officers pursuant to Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act.

Financial Reporting Measures may or may not be filed with the SEC and may be presented outside the Company’s financial statements.\\n\\n“Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\\n\\n“Lookback Period” means the three completed fiscal years (plus any transition period of less than nine months that is within or immediately following the three completed fiscal years and that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare a Restatement for a given reporting period, with such date being the earlier of: (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Restatement, or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a Restatement.

We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes and the content we produce and distribute through our service. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary.

      "The media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix. This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the extent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\n",

      "# HUMAN CAPITAL\n",
      "\n",
      "We view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 13,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,000 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,000 (15%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 500 (4%) in Latin America and 1,500 (12%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year. We believe a critical component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our associates to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of excellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. We empower all of our employees so that they can have significant impact and input into decision-making; each employee has a high degree of freedom and power to make the decisions and take actions in the best interest of the company in carrying out their role. In return, our employees are responsible and accountable for those decisions and actions. With this approach, we believe we are a more flexible, fun, stimulating, creative, collaborative and successful organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it’s important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by training our recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\n",
      "\n",
      "We believe in fostering great leaders. We offer programs, such as seminars and lectures, that are designed to equip our leaders (officers, VPs, people managers and director and senior manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic goals. We have built a portfolio of programs under three foundational pillars - great company, great leaders, and great human beings - which we believe support our current and future success. We also offer programs and workshops to provide skills and coaching to employees on a variety of topics, such as leading and inspiring.\n",

      "\n",
      "We aim to generally pay our employees at the top of their personal market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender (globally) and race (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "We care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\n",

Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video.

Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules, regulations, and industry standards, including data storage requirements, additional authentication requirements for certain payment methods, and require payment of interchange and other fees.

In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill subscribers on our behalf.

      "Our ability to provide our members with content they can enjoy depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including necessary distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Music and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations (“CMOs”) and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to expose us to greater distribution expenses in certain markets.\n",

These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. We and many of the third parties we work with rely on open source software and libraries that are integrated into a variety of applications, tools and systems, which may increase our exposure to vulnerabilities. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees, vendors, partners, or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. However, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent unauthorized access or address all cybersecurity incidents that occur. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) have been and may continue to be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. We do not carry insurance to cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain.

The U.S. federal and state governments, countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do business.

      "Given the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Also, predicting consumer adoption of various pricing strategies, such as the ad-supported subscription plan or efforts to limit multi-household usage, and new revenue streams, such as advertising revenue, is inherently difficult given the lack of operating history with respect to such offerings, and actual results may differ significantly from the expectations of our management, securities analysts or investors. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the content amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series, documentary or feature film based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing or recognition of content amortization. If we revise such estimates it could result in greater in-period expenses, which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price. Further, events outside of our control may cause actual results to differ from our forecast.\n",

      "\n",
      "We define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\n",
      "\n",
      "In assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the major recurring differences are the timing impact between content payments and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, non-cash remeasurement gain/loss on our euro-denominated debt, excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation, and other working capital differences. Working capital differences primarily include deferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly.\n",

      "In the normal course of business, we, or a third-party producing content on our behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on our service. Upon a title’s launch, any amounts we are eligible for through qualified production spend but have not received, are recognized in “Other current assets” or “Other non-current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets (presented in “Content assets, net”) and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in “Cost of revenues”) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value.

      "We operate our business globally and transact in multiple currencies. Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 57% of revenue and 28% of operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, with our largest exposures being the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, and the Mexican peso.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, volatility in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our revenues would have been approximately $597 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those in the same period of 2022. See Part II, Item 7, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency.\n",

      "In the year ended December 31, 2023, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues occurring in January 2024 and beyond from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI\") and reclassify the amounts into “Revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the U.S dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $958 million lower. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in earnings.\n",

These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into “Cost of Revenues” to offset the hedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. If the U.S dollar strengthened by 10% as of December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $71 million lower. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying exposures when recognized in earnings.\n",

      "We have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a $293 million foreign exchange loss primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and content liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies.\n",

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n",

      "\n",
      "As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, the Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming (“Content”). The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company’s Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.\n",
      "\n",
      "# How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n",
      "\n",
      "We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management’s controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management’s assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions.\n",

Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as “Content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. The Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the normal course of business, the Company, or a third-party producing content on the Company's behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on the Company’s service. Upon a title’s launch, any amounts the Company is eligible for through qualified production spend but has not received, are recognized in “Other current assets” or “Other non-current assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of the Company’s content assets (presented in “Content assets, net”) and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in “Cost of revenues”) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\n",

      "- a) “Company Group” means the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable.\n",
      "- b) “Covered Compensation” means any Incentive-Based Compensation granted, vested or paid to a person who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for the Incentive-Based Compensation and that was Received (i) on or after the effective date of the applicable Nasdaq listing standards, (ii) after the person became an Executive Officer and (iii) at a time that the Company had a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association.\n",
      "- c) “Effective Date” means October 27, 2023.\n",
      "- d) “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of Covered Compensation granted, vested or paid to a person during the fiscal period when the applicable Financial Reporting Measure relating to such Covered Compensation was attained that exceeds the amount of Covered Compensation that otherwise would have been granted, vested or paid to the person had such amount been determined based on the applicable Restatement, computed without regard to any taxes paid (i.e., on a pre-tax basis). For Covered Compensation based on stock price or total stockholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in a Restatement, the Committee will determine the amount of such Covered Compensation that constitutes Erroneously Awarded Compensation, if any, based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the stock price or total stockholder return upon which the Covered Compensation was granted, vested or paid and the Committee shall maintain documentation of such determination and provide such documentation to the Nasdaq.\n",
      "- e) “Exchange Act” means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n",
      "- f) “Executive Officer” means each “officer” of the Company as defined under Rule 16a-1(f) under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, which shall be deemed to include any individuals identified by the Company as executive officers pursuant to Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. Both current and former Executive Officers are subject to the Policy in accordance with its terms.\n",

We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\\n\\n#### ',\n",
       " 'REGULATION',\n",
       " '\\n\\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many countries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some countries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix. This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even restrict the extent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that could require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and may make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\\n\\n#### ',\n",
       " 'HUMAN CAPITAL',\n",
       " '\\n\\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 13,000 full-time employees. Of these, approximately 9,000 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,000 (15%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 500 (4%) in Latin America and 1,500 (12%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose numbers fluctuate throughout the year. We believe a critical component of our success is our company culture. This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our associates to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of excellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of perspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. We empower all of our employees so that they can have significant impact and input into decision-making; each employee has a high degree of freedom and power to make the decisions and take actions in the best interest of the company in carrying out their role. In return, our employees are responsible and accountable for those decisions and actions. With this approach, we believe we are a more flexible, fun, stimulating, creative, collaborative and successful organization.\\n\\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences across and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity, inclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each Netflix employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it\\'s important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by training our recruiters on how to hire more inclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing employees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion initiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\\n\\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer programs, such as seminars and lectures, that are designed to equip our leaders (officers, VPs, people managers and director and senior manager-level employees) to lead the business and our teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic goals. We have built a portfolio of programs under three foundational pillars - great company, great leaders, and great human beings - which we believe support our current and future success. We also offer programs and workshops to provide skills and coaching to employees on a variety of topics, such as leading and inspiring\\n\\nteams. We believe this focus helps our employees grow as leaders and well-rounded individuals, and better positions Netflix to operate our global business of providing compelling content to entertain the world.\\n\\nWe aim to generally pay our employees at the top of their personal market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between cash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee\\'s individual needs and preferences. We conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender (globally) and race (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\\n\\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health benefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a way that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match for charitable donations.\\n\\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.\\n\\n#### ',\n",

       " '\\n\\nWe must continually add new members both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. Our penetration and growth rates have fluctuated and vary across the jurisdictions where we provide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in newer or less penetrated countries. Our ability to continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling content choices that keep our members engaged with our service, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality experience for choosing and enjoying TV series, films and games. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, and streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time.\\n\\nMembers cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, that they need to cut household expenses, dissatisfaction with content, a preference for competitive services and customer service issues that they believe are not satisfactorily resolved. Membership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content release schedules. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, may also adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. If we do not grow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues, including by adjusting membership pricing, commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted.

We have recently expanded our entertainment video offering to include games. If our efforts to develop and offer games are not valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may also seek to extend our business into new products and services to help drive growth. For example, we are expanding our offering of consumer products and live experiences.

       " '\\n\\nThe market for entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture\\n\\nmeaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content, large content libraries, and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. In addition, new technological developments, including the development and use of generative artificial intelligence, are rapidly evolving. If our competitors gain an advantage by using such technologies, our ability to compete effectively and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Piracy also threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. In light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth, and our efforts to prevent that growth may be insufficient. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\\n\\n### We ',\n",

We devote significant resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series, documentaries, feature films and games.

To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As a content producer, we are responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments, and take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Further, negotiations or renewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements have, and in the future, could negatively impact timing and costs associated with our productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming. We may face potential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law, become insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming, and/or license such rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise.

For example, European law enables individual member states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators located outside their jurisdiction. Several jurisdictions have and others may, over time, impose financial and regulatory obligations on us. In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us.

In others, the laws may be nascent or non-existent. Furthermore, favorable laws may change, including for example, in the United States where net neutrality regulations were repealed. Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing interpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.\\n\\n### We are ',\n",

While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\\n\\n### Our \",\n",

       " '\\n\\nOur ability to provide our members with content they can enjoy depends on obtaining various rights from third parties upon terms acceptable to us, including necessary distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively quickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition increases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights when obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient manner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member acquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\\n\\nMusic and certain authors\\' performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we engage in negotiations with collection management organizations (\"CMOs\") and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in intellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable terms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely impact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could adversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby adversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential liability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for CMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to expose us to greater distribution expenses in certain markets.\\n\\n### If our ',\n",

We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. In addition, the use or adoption of new and emerging technologies may increase our exposure to intellectual property claims, and the availability of copyright and other intellectual property protection for AI-generated material is uncertain. Many companies are devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current website, streaming technology, our recommendation and merchandising technology or inability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing materials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims.

Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems or data used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our service to existing and potential members.\\n\\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, or insider threats, as well as misconfigurations in information systems, networks, software or hardware, and similar disruptions or errors. These systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. We and many of the third parties we work with rely on open source software and libraries that are integrated into a variety of applications, tools and systems, which may increase our exposure to vulnerabilities. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees, vendors, partners, or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could harm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems. However, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate, detect or prevent unauthorized access or address all cybersecurity incidents that occur. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) have been and may continue to be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced an unauthorized release of certain digital content assets. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not had a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the future. We do not carry insurance to cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service offering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members and adversely affect our business and results of operation.

Further, we may be unable to react to any reduction in our cash flows from operations, including those caused by a downturn in the economy, by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce, will typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not fund the production of such content.

We are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the IRS, state, local, and foreign tax authorities, some of whom are challenging our tax positions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes. If the ultimate determination of income and other tax liabilities differ from the amounts recorded or accrued, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\\n\\nTax laws are regularly being re-examined and evaluated globally. New laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for financial statement purposes in the quarter or year that they become applicable. Tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies and we have tax audits pending in several jurisdictions. The U.S. federal and state governments, countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do business. If U.S. or other tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge how or where our profits are currently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\\n\\n#### ',\n",

Also, predicting consumer adoption of various pricing strategies, such as the ad-supported subscription plan or efforts to limit multi-household usage, and new revenue streams, such as advertising revenue, is inherently difficult given the lack of operating history with respect to such offerings, and actual results may differ significantly from the expectations of our management, securities analysts or investors. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America also requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the content amortization pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series, documentary or feature film based upon various factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing or recognition of content amortization. If we revise such estimates it could result in greater in-period expenses, which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively impact our stock price. Further, events outside of our control may cause actual results to differ from our forecast.\\n\\n#### ',\n",

The discontinuance of our DVD business had an immaterial impact on our operations and financial results.\\n\\nConsolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 7% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased three percentage points, primarily due to revenues growing at a faster rate as compared to the growth in cost of revenues and marketing and decreased technology and development expenses, partially offset by higher growth in general and administrative expenses as compared to the growth in revenues.\\n\\n#### *Streaming Revenues*\\n\\nWe primarily derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of December 31, 2023, pricing on our paid plans ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1 to $28 per month, and pricing on our extra member sub accounts ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2 to $8 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations.\\n\\nWe also earn revenue from advertisements presented on our streaming service, consumer products and various other sources. Revenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not material for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\\n\\n|  | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |  |  |  | Change |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2023 |  |  | 2022 | 2021 |  | 2023 vs. 2022 |  |\\n|  |  |  |  |  | (in thousands, except percentages) |  |  |  |\\n| Streaming revenues |  | $ 33,640,458 | $ | 31,469,852 | $ | 29,515,496 $ | 2,170,606 | 7 % |\\n\\nStreaming revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 7% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the 8% growth in average paying memberships, partially offset by a 1% decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership. The decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership was primarily due to changes in plan mix, higher membership growth in regions with lower average monthly revenue per paying membership, partially offset by limited price increases. Additionally, streaming revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were further impacted by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\\n\\nThe following tables summarize streaming revenue and other streaming membership information by region for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\\n\\n#### ',\n",

Certain members have the option to add extra member sub accounts. These extra member sub accounts are not included in paid memberships. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company\\'s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.\\n\\n(2) We believe the non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency revenue is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership absent foreign currency fluctuations. However, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on average monthly revenue per paying membership, we estimate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our revenues would have been approximately $597 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December 31, 2022.\\n\\n#### *Cost* of *Revenues*\\n\\nAmortization of content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues. Expenses directly associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content (such as payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other related personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations costs make up the remainder of cost of revenues. We have built our own global content delivery network (\"Open Connect\") to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering content over the internet. Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs directly incurred in making our content available to members.\\n\\n|  | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |  |  |  |  | Change |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2023 2021 |  |  | 2022 |  |  |  | 2023 vs. 2022 |  |\\n|  | (in thousands, except percentages) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| Cost of revenues | $ | 19,715,368 | $ | 19,168,285 | $ | 17,332,683 | $ 547,083 |  | 3 % |\\n| As a percentage of revenues | 58 % |  |  | 61 % |  | 58 % |  |  |  |\\n\\nThe increase in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was due to a $171 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new content, coupled with a $376 million increase in other cost of revenues primarily due to an increase in expenses directly associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content.\\n\\n#### *Marketing*\\n\\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to our marketing and advertising sales partners, including consumer electronics (\"CE\") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), mobile operators and ISPs. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Marketing expenses also include payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other related expenses for personnel that support sales and marketing activities.\\n\\n|  | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |  |  |  | Change |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2023 |  |  | 2022 |  | 2021 | 2023 vs. 2022 |  |  |\\n|  |  |  |  |  |  | (in thousands, except percentages) |  |  |  |\\n| Marketing |  | $ 2,657,883 | $ | 2,530,502 | $ | 2,545,146 | $ | 127,381 | 5 % |\\n| As a percentage of revenues |  |  | 8 % | 8 % |  | 9 % |  |  |  |\\n\\nThe increase in marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to a $146 million increase in advertising expenses and a $21 million increase in personnel-related costs, partially offset by a $39 million decrease in payments to our marketing partners.\\n\\n#### *Technology* and *Development*\\n\\nTechnology and development expenses consist primarily of payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other related expenses for technology personnel responsible for making improvements to our service offerings, including testing, maintaining and modifying our user interface, our recommendations, merchandising and infrastructure. Technology and development expenses also include costs associated with general use computer hardware and software.\\n\\n|  |  |  |  | Year Ended December 31, |  | Change |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2023 2022 2021 |  |  |  |  | 2023 vs. 2022 |  |  |\\n|  | (in thousands, except percentages) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| Technology and development | $ $ | 2,675,758 | $ | 2,711,041 | 2,273,885 $ |  | (35,283) | (1)% |\\n| As a percentage of revenues |  |  | 8 % | 9 % | 8 % |  |  |  |\\n\\nTechnology and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 remained relatively flat.\\n\\n#### *General* and *Administrative*\\n\\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other related expenses for corporate personnel. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees and other general corporate expenses.\\n\\n|  | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |  |  |  | Change |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2023 |  |  | 2022 | 2021 | 2023 vs. 2022 |  |  |\\n|  |  |  |  |  | (in thousands, except percentages) |  |  |  |\\n| General and administrative | $ | $ 1,720,285 | $ | 1,572,891 | 1,351,621 $ |  | 147,394 | 9 % |\\n| As a percentage of revenues |  |  | 5 % | 5 % | 5 % |  |  |  |\\n\\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to a $82 million increase in third-party expenses and a $78 million increase in personnel-related costs.\\n\\n#### *Interest Expense*\\n\\nInterest expense consists primarily of the interest associated with our outstanding debt obligations, including the amortization of debt issuance costs. See Note 6 *Debt* in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail on our debt obligations.\\n\\n|  | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |  |  |  | Change |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2023 2022 |  |  |  | 2021 | 2023 vs. 2022 |  |  |\\n|  |  |  |  | (in thousands, except percentages) |  |  |  |  |\\n| Interest expense | $ $ | $ 699,826 | 706,212 | 765,620 |  | $ | (6,386) | (1)% |\\n| As a percentage of revenues |  | 2 % | 2 % | 3 % |  |  |  |  |\\n\\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted primarily of $698 million of interest on our Notes. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 remained relatively flat.\\n\\n#### *Interest* and *Other Income (Expense)*\\n\\nInterest and other income (expense) consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated balances and interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\\n\\n|  | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |  |  |  | Change |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2023 2022 |  |  |  |  | 2021 | 2023 vs. 2022 |  |  |\\n|  |  |  |  |  | (in thousands, except percentages) |  |  |  |  |\\n| Interest and other income (expense) | $ $ | (48,772) | $ | 337,310 |  | 411,214 | $ | (386,082) | (114)% |\\n| As a percentage of revenues |  | — % |  | 1 % |  | 1 % |  |  |  |\\n\\nInterest and other income (expense) decreased primarily due to foreign exchange losses of $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to a gain of $282 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The foreign exchange loss in the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by the non-cash loss of $176 million from the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, coupled with the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies. The foreign exchange gain in the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by the non-cash $353 million gain from the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies. The change in foreign currency gains and losses was partially offset by a $221 million increase in interest income earned due to higher average interest rates and investment balances for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\\n\\n#### *Provision* for *Income Taxes*\\n\\n|  | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |  |  | Change |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2023 2022 |  |  | 2021 |  | 2023 vs. 2022 |  |\\n|  |  |  |  | (in thousands, except percentages) |  |  |  |\\n| Provision for income taxes | $ $ $ | 797,415 | 772,005 | 723,875 | $ | 25,410 | 3 % |\\n| Effective tax rate | 13 % 15 % |  |  |  | 12 % |  |  |\\n\\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to a decrease in foreign taxes. See Note 10 *Income Taxes* to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\\n\\n### ',\n",

The amount of principal and interest due in the next twelve months is $1,077 million. The amount of principal and interest due beyond the next twelve months is $16,662 million. As of December 31, 2023, no amounts had been borrowed under our $1 billion Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 6 *Debt* in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nWe anticipate that our future capital needs from the debt market will be more limited compared to prior years. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose or need, including for potential strategic acquisitions and investments, will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\\n\\nIn March 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration date, and in September 2023, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $10 billion, also with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 14,513,790 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $6,045 million. As of December 31, 2023, $8.4 billion remains available for repurchases.\\n\\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related costs, as well as strategic acquisitions and investments. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly invest in global content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\\n\\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations. As of December 31, 2023, the expected timing of those payments are as follows:\\n\\n| Contractual obligations (in thousands): |  | Total | Next 12 Months |  | Beyond 12 Months |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Content obligations (1) | $ | 21,713,349 | $ | 10,328,923 | $ | 11,384,426 |\\n| Debt (2) |  | 17,739,159 |  | 1,077,261 |  | 16,661,898 |\\n| Operating lease obligations (3) |  | 3,088,899 |  | 513,506 |  | 2,575,393 |\\n| Total | $ | 42,541,407 | $ | 11,919,690 | $ | 30,621,717 |\\n\\n(1) As of December 31, 2023, content obligations were comprised of $4.5 billion included in \"Current content liabilities\" and $2.6 billion of \"Non-current content liabilities\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $14.6 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition.\\n\\nContent obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\\n\\n- (2) Debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 6 *Debt* in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\\n- (3) Operating lease obligations are comprised of operating lease liabilities included in \"Accrued expenses and other liabilities\" and \"Other non-current liabilities\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, inclusive of imputed interest. Operating lease obligations also include additional obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not meet the criteria for recognition. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has additional operating leases for real estate that have not yet commenced of $343 million which has been included above. See Note 5 *Balance Sheet Components* in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding leases.\\n\\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2023, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $327 million, of which $221 million was classified in \"Other noncurrent liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.\\n\\n#### *Free Cash Flow*\\n\\nWe define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and change in other assets. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make strategic acquisitions and investments and for certain other activities like stock repurchases. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.\\n\\nIn assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the major recurring differences are the timing impact between content payments and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, non-cash remeasurement gain/loss on our eurodenominated debt, excess property and equipment purchases over depreciation, and other working capital differences. Working capital differences primarily include deferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly.\\n\\n|  | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |  |  |  | Change |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2023 |  |  | 2022 |  | 2021 | 2023 vs. 2022 |  |  |\\n|  |  |  |  | (in thousands) |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| Net cash provided by operating activities | $ | 7,274,301 | $ | 2,026,257 | $ | 392,610 | $ | 5,248,044 | 259 % |\\n| Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities |  | 541,751 |  | (2,076,392) |  | (1,339,853) |  | 2,618,143 | 126 % |\\n| Net cash used in financing activities |  | (5,950,803) |  | (664,254) |  | (1,149,776) |  | 5,286,549 | 796 % |\\n| Non-GAAP reconciliation of free cash flow: |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| Net cash provided by operating activities |  | 7,274,301 |  | 2,026,257 |  | 392,610 |  | 5,248,044 | 259 % |\\n| Purchases of property and equipment |  | (348,552) |  | (407,729) |  | (524,585) |  | (59,177) | (15)% |\\n| Change in other assets |  | — |  | — |  | (26,919) |  | — | — % |\\n| Free cash flow | $ | 6,925,749 | $ | 1,618,528 | $ | (158,894) | $ | 5,307,221 | 328 % |\\n\\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $5,248 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 to $7,274 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by a decrease in payments for content assets, coupled with a $916 million or 20% increase in net income and favorable changes in working capital. The payments for content assets decreased $3,519 million, from $16,660 million to $13,140 million, or 21%.\\n\\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities increased $2,618 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 to $542 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities is primarily due to proceeds from the maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases, and there being no acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to acquisitions for an aggregate amount of $757 million in the year ended December 31, 2022.\\n\\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $5,287 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 to $5,951 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in net cash used in financing activities is primarily due to repurchases of common stock for an aggregate amount of $6,045 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to no repurchases of common stock in the year ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by the absence of debt maturities in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the repayment upon maturity of the $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.500% Senior Notes in February 2022.\\n\\nFree cash flow was $1,518 million higher than net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to $1,057 million of amortization expense exceeding cash payments for content assets, $339 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, $176 million of non-cash remeasurement loss on our euro-denominated debt, and $47 million in other favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $101 million of property and equipment purchases exceeding depreciation expense.\\n\\n#### *Indemnifications*\\n\\nThe information set forth under Note 8 *Commitments* and *Contingencies* in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.\\n\\n#### ',\n",
       " 'Critical Accounting Estimates',\n",
       " '\\n\\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company\\'s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company\\'s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\\n\\n#### *Content*\\n\\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\\n\\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\\n\\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in \"Cost of revenues\" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years\\n\\nafter its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\\n\\nIn the normal course of business, we, or a third-party producing content on our behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on our service. Upon a title\\'s launch, any amounts we are eligible for through qualified production spend but have not received, are recognized in \"Other current assets\" or \"Other non-current assets\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets (presented in \"Content assets, net\") and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in \"Cost of revenues\") on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\n\\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\\n\\n#### *Income Taxes*\\n\\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not they will not be realized.\\n\\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.\\n\\nWe do not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.\\n\\nSee Note 10 *Income Taxes* to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\\n\\n#### *Recent Accounting Pronouncements*\\n\\nThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption \"Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" is incorporated herein by reference.\\n\\n### ',\n",

       " 'Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk',\n",
       " '\\n\\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations.\\n\\n#### *Interest Rate Risk*\\n\\nAt December 31, 2023, our cash equivalents and short-term investments were generally invested in money market funds and time deposits. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $14.6 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fourteen tranches due between 2024 and 2030. Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value\\n\\nof our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\\n\\n#### *Foreign Currency Risk*\\n\\nWe operate our business globally and transact in multiple currencies. Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 57% of revenue and 28% of operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, with our largest exposures being the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, and the Mexican peso.\\n\\nAccordingly, volatility in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our revenues would have been approximately $597 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those in the same period of 2022. See Part II, Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency.\\n\\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues occurring in January 2024 and beyond from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") and reclassify the amounts into \"Revenues\" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the U.S dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $958 million lower. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in earnings.\\n\\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, we also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted and firmly committed U.S. dollar-equivalent transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets occurring in January 2024 and beyond from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into \"Cost of Revenues\" to offset the hedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. If the U.S dollar strengthened by 10% as of December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $71 million lower. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying exposures when recognized in earnings.\\n\\nWe have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a $293 million foreign exchange loss primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and content liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies.\\n\\nIn addition, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as disclosed on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the year ended December 31, 2023 was an increase of $83 million.\\n\\n#### ',\n",

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\n\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\n\\n|  | Content Amortization |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Description of the Matter | As disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements \"Organization and Summary of Significant |\\n|  | Accounting Policies\", the Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming |\\n|  | (\"Content\"). The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. |\\n|  | Auditing the amortization of the Company\\'s Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of |\\n|  | amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on |\\n|  | historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of |\\n|  | amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization. |\\n| How We Addressed the | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the |\\n| Matter in Our Audit | content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management\\'s review of the content amortization |\\n|  | method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to |\\n|  | develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management\\'s controls to determine that the data used in the |\\n|  | model was complete and accurate. |\\n|  | To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization |\\n|  | method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the |\\n|  | completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management\\'s assumptions by |\\n|  | comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates |\\n|  | of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the |\\n|  | content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. |\\n\\nWe have served as the Company\\'s auditor since 2012.

       " '\\n\\n#### *Description* of *Business*\\n\\nNetflix, Inc. (the \"Company\") was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is one of the world\\'s leading entertainment services with over 260 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\\n\\n#### *Basis* of *Presentation*\\n\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\n\\n#### Use of *Estimates*\\n\\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates\\n\\n#### *Recently issued accounting pronouncements* not yet *adopted*\\n\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-07, *Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements* to *Reportable Segment Disclosures*, which requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments\\' significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-07.\\n\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, *Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements* to *Income* Tax *Disclosures*, which requires public entities, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09.\\n\\n#### *Cash Equivalents* and *Short-term Investments*\\n\\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also classifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions that it expects to settle within several days as cash equivalents.\\n\\nThe Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale. Short-term investments are reported at fair value, with allowances for credit losses included in \"Interest and other income (expense)\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and unrealized gains and losses included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" within Stockholders\\' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company uses the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of short-term investments.\\n\\nShort-term investments are reviewed periodically for allowances for credit losses and impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company reviews factors such as the extent to which the fair value of the security is less than the amortized cost basis, adverse conditions specifically related to the security, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company\\'s intent to sell, and whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.\\n\\n#### *Content*\\n\\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\\n\\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.\\n\\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in \"Cost of revenues\" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. The Company\\'s estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\\n\\nIn the normal course of business, the Company, or a third-party producing content on the Company\\'s behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on the Company\\'s service. Upon a title\\'s launch, any amounts the Company is eligible for through qualified production spend but has not received, are recognized in \"Other current assets\" or \"Other non-current assets\" on the Company\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of the Company\\'s content assets (presented in \"Content assets, net\") and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in \"Cost of revenues\") on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\\n\\n#### *Acquisitions*\\n\\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date.\\n\\n#### *Property* and *Equipment*\\n\\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\\n\\n#### *Trade Receivables*\\n\\nTrade receivables consist primarily of amounts related to members and payment partners that collect membership fees on the Company\\'s behalf. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit losses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors. The Company\\'s allowance for credit losses was not material as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\\n\\n#### *Revenue Recognition*\\n\\nThe Company\\'s primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are\\n\\npresented net of the taxes that are collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including consumer electronics (\"CE\") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), mobile operators and internet service providers (\"ISPs\"), provide access to the service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members. In circumstances in which the price that the member pays is established by a partner and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), the net amount collected from the partner is recognized as revenue.\\n\\nThe Company also earns revenue from advertisements presented on its streaming service, consumer products and various other sources. Revenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not material for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. See Note 2 *Revenue Recognition* to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding revenues.\\n\\n#### *Marketing*\\n\\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to the Company\\'s partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs. Marketing expenses also include payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other related expenses for personnel that support the Company\\'s sales and marketing activities. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $1,732 million, $1,586 million and $1,669 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\n\\n#### *Income Taxes*\\n\\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. We account for the tax effects of global intangible low tax income as a current period expense.\\n\\nThe Company does not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 10 *Income Taxes* to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\\n\\n#### *Foreign Currency*\\n\\nThe functional currency for the Company\\'s subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income\" in Stockholders\\' equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\n\\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in \"Interest and other income (expense)\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign currency transactions resulted in a loss of $293 million, a gain of $282 million, and a gain of $403 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. These gains and losses were primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies.\\n\\n### *Derivative Financial Instruments*\\n\\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to manage foreign exchange risk related to its ongoing business operations with the primary objective of reducing operating income and cash flow volatility associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\\n\\nThe Company enters into forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk on forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, as well as the foreign exchange risk on forecasted transactions and firm commitments related to the licensing and production of foreign currency-denominated content assets. These forward contracts\\n\\nare designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency firm commitments and forecasted transactions and generally have maturities of 24 months or less. The hedging contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures.\\n\\nThe Company recognizes derivative instruments at fair value as either assets (presented in \"Other current assets\" and \"Other non-current assets\") or liabilities (presented in \"Accrued expenses and other liabilities\\'\\' and \"Other non-current liabilities\") on the Company\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies derivative instruments in the Level 2 category within the fair value hierarchy.\\n\\nThe gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") and reclassified into \"Revenues\" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of firmly committed or forecasted transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets is initially reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into \"Cost of Revenues\" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\\n\\nIn the event that the likelihood of occurrence of the underlying forecasted transactions is determined to be probable not to occur, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI to \"Interest and other income (expense)\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of dedesignation.\\n\\nSee Note 7 *Derivative Financial Instruments* to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company\\'s derivative financial instruments.\\n\\n#### *Stock-Based Compensation*\\n\\nThe Company grants non-qualified stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. Stock-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the options at the grant date and is recognized, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service period. See Note 9 *Stockholders\\' Equity* to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding stock-based compensation.\\n\\n#### 2. ',\n",

Certain members have the option to add extra member sub accounts. These extra member sub accounts are not included in paid memberships. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in the above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary cancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by the Company's internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.\\n\\nDeferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized, as well as gift and other prepaid memberships that have not been fully redeemed. As of December 31, 2023, total deferred revenue was $1,443 million, the vast majority of which was related to membership fees billed that are expected to be recognized as revenue within the next month. The remaining deferred revenue balance, which is related to gift cards and other prepaid memberships, will be recognized as revenue over the period of service after redemption, which is expected to occur over the next 12 months. The $178 million increase in deferred revenue as compared to the balance of $1,265 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, is a result of the increase in membership fees billed due to increased memberships.\\n\\n### 3. \",\n",

These leases generally have terms which range from 1 year to 15 years, and often include one or more options to renew. These renewal terms can extend the lease term from 1 year to 20 years, and are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. These operating leases are included in \"Other non-current assets\" on the Company\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets, and represent the Company\\'s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The Company\\'s obligations to make lease payments are included in \"Accrued expenses and other liabilities\" and \"Other non-current liabilities\" on the Company\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease rightof-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company has entered into various short-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less. These leases are not recorded on the Company\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets. All operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Because the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company has certain contracts for real estate which may contain lease and non-lease components which it has elected to treat as a single lease component.\\n\\nThe components of lease costs for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\\n\\n|  | Year ended December 31, |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2023 |  | 2022 |  | 2021 |  |\\n|  |  |  | (in thousands) |  |  |  |\\n| Operating lease cost | $ | $ 430,856 |  | 413,664 | $ | 389,805 |\\n| Short-term lease cost |  | 207,822 |  | 194,764 |  | 152,765 |\\n| Total lease cost | $ | $ 638,678 |  | 608,428 | $ | 542,570 |\\n\\nInformation related to the Company\\'s operating right-of-use assets and related operating lease liabilities were as follows:\\n\\n|  | Year ended December 31, |  |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2023 2022 |  |  | 2021 |  |\\n|  | (in thousands) |  |  |  |  |\\n| Cash paid for operating lease liabilities | $ | $ 451,525 | 413,034 | $ | 349,586 |\\n| Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease obligations |  | 196,639 | 252,393 |  | 764,142 |\\n\\n|  |  | As of December 31, |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2023 |  | 2022 |  |\\n|  |  | (in thousands, except lease term and discount rate) |  |  |\\n| Operating lease right-of-use assets, net | $ | 2,076,899 | $ | 2,227,122 |\\n| Current operating lease liabilities | $ | 383,312 | $ | 355,985 |\\n| Non-current operating lease liabilities |  | 2,046,801 |  | 2,222,503 |\\n| Total operating lease liabilities | $ | 2,430,113 | $ | 2,578,488 |\\n| Weighted-average remaining lease term |  | 7.5 years |  | 8.3 years |\\n| Weighted-average discount rate |  | 3.3 % |  | 3.2 % |\\n\\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 were as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n| Due in 12 month period ended December 31, |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 2024 |  | $ | 460,353 |\\n| 2025 |  |  | 424,897 |\\n| 2026 |  |  | 401,306 |\\n| 2027 |  |  | 340,245 |\\n| 2028 |  |  | 282,465 |\\n| Thereafter |  |  | 827,117 |\\n|  |  |  | 2,736,383 |\\n| Less imputed interest |  |  | (306,270) |\\n|  | Total operating lease liabilities $ |  | 2,430,113 |\\n\\nThe Company has additional operating leases for real estate of $343 million which have not commenced as of December 31, 2023, and as such, have not been recognized on the Company\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

       " '\\n\\n#### *Content*\\n\\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had $21.7 billion of obligations comprised of $4.5 billion included in \"Current content liabilities\" and $2.6 billion of \"Non-current content liabilities\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $14.6 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for recognition.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company had $21.8 billion of obligations comprised of $4.5 billion included in \"Current content liabilities\" and $3.1 billion of \"Non-current content liabilities\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $14.2 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for recognition.\\n\\nThe expected timing of payments for these content obligations is as follows:\\n\\n|  | As of December 31, |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2023 |  |  | 2022 |\\n|  | (in thousands) |  |  |  |\\n| Less than one year | $ | 10,328,923 | $ | 10,038,483 |\\n| Due after one year and through 3 years |  | 8,784,302 |  | 9,425,551 |\\n| Due after 3 years and through 5 years |  | 2,016,358 |  | 2,124,307 |\\n| Due after 5 years |  | 583,766 |  | 243,606 |\\n| Total content obligations | $ | 21,713,349 | $ | 21,831,947 |\\n\\nContent obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content. Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.\\n\\n### *Legal Proceedings*\\n\\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company\\'s view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company\\'s operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\\n\\nThe Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time. The Company\\'s view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\\n\\n#### *Non-Income Taxes*\\n\\nThe Company is routinely under audit by various tax authorities with regard to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to our revenue in certain jurisdictions. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\\n\\nSimilar to other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the Company is involved in a number of matters with Brazilian tax authorities regarding nonincome tax assessments. Although the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these matters, there is inherent complexity and uncertainty with respect to these matters, and the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. The current potential exposure with respect to the various issues with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments is estimated to be approximately $300 million, which is expected to increase over time.\\n\\n#### *Guarantees—Indemnification Obligations*\\n\\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company\\'s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify\\n\\nthem against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The terms of such obligations vary.\\n\\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company\\'s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.\\n\\n### 9. ',\n",

This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company's common stock.\\n\\nA summary of the amounts related to option exercises, is as follows:\\n\\n|  |  |  |  | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2023 2022 |  |  |  |  | 2021 |\\n|  | (in thousands) |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| Total intrinsic value of options exercised |  | $ 610,594 | $ | 345,839 | $ | 1,362,599 |\\n| Cash received from options exercised |  | 169,990 |  | 35,746 |  | 174,414 |\\n\\n#### *Stock-Based Compensation*\\n\\nStock options are generally vested in full upon grant date and exercisable for the full ten year contractual term regardless of employment status. Stock options granted to certain named executive officers vest on the one-year anniversary of the grant date, subject to the employee's continuous employment or service with the Company through the vesting date. The following table summarizes the assumptions used to value option grants using the lattice-binomial model and the valuation data:\\n\\n|  |  |  |  | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  |  | 2023 |  | 2022 |  | 2021 |\\n| Dividend yield |  | — % |  | — % |  | — % |\\n| Expected volatility |  | 40% - 46% |  | 38% - 52% |  | 34% - 41% |\\n| Risk-free interest rate |  | 3.57% - 4.56% |  | 1.71% - 3.79% |  | 1.08% - 1.62% |\\n| Suboptimal exercise factor |  | 4.22 - 4.30 |  | 4.71 - 4.82 |  | 3.81 - 3.98 |\\n| Valuation data: |  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| Weighted-average fair value (per share) | $ | 211.27 | $ | 155.88 | $ | 259.01 |\\n| Total stock-based compensation expense (in thousands) |  | 339,368 |  | 575,452 |  | 403,220 |\\n| Total income tax impact on provision (in thousands) |  | 61,588 |  | 127,289 |  | 89,642 |\\n\\nThe Company considers several factors in determining the suboptimal exercise factor, including the historical and estimated option exercise behavior.\\n\\nThe Company calculates expected volatility based solely on implied volatility. The Company believes that implied volatility of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reflective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its common stock.\\n\\nIn valuing shares issued under the Company's employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are generally fully vested upon grant date.\\n\\nThe total fair value of stock options that vested during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $311 million. The Company did not grant any stock options subject to vesting conditions in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2023, $26 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.45 years.\\n\\n### *Stock Repurchases*\\n\\nIn March 2021, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of its common stock, with no expiration date, and in September 2023, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $10 billion, also with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. The Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. The Company may discontinue any repurchases of its common stock at any time without prior notice. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 14,513,790 shares for an aggregate amount of $6,045 million. As of December 31, 2023, $8.4 billion remains available for repurchases. Shares repurchased by the Company are accounted for when the transaction is settled. Direct costs incurred to acquire the shares are included in the total cost of the shares.\\n\\n#### *Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)*\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the changes in accumulated balances of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax:\\n\\n|  | Foreign Currency |  | Change in Unrealized |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | Translation |  | Gains (Losses) on Cash |  |  |  |\\n|  | Adjustments |  | Flow Hedges |  | Total |  |\\n|  |  |  | (in thousands) |  |  |  |\\n| Balances as of December 31, 2020 | $ | 44,398 | $ | — $ |  | 44,398 |\\n| Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications |  | (84,893) |  | — |  | (84,893) |\\n| Balances as of December 31, 2021 |  | (40,495) |  | — |  | (40,495) |\\n| Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications |  | (176,811) |  | — |  | (176,811) |\\n| Balances as of December 31, 2022 |  | (217,306) |  | — |  | (217,306) |\\n| Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications |  | 113,384 |  | (120,023) |  | (6,639) |\\n| Balances as of December 31, 2023 | $ | (103,922) | $ | (120,023) | $ | (223,945) |\\n\\n#### 10. \",\n",

million of California R&D tax credit carryforwards which can be carried forward indefinitely, $838 million of state net operating loss carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2026, $19 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2033, and $421 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards which will begin to expire in 2024.\\n\\nIn evaluating its ability to realize the net deferred tax assets, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including its past operating results and the forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. As of December 31, 2023, the valuation allowance of $442 million was primarily related to California R&D tax credits, state net operating loss carryforwards, and foreign tax credits that the Company does not expect to realize.\\n\\nAt December 31, 2023, we have not provided for applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $52 million of our foreign undistributed earnings because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested. At December 31, 2023, we provided taxes and recorded a deferred tax liability on our undistributed foreign earnings for which we are not indefinitely reinvested.\\n\\nThe unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year are classified as \"Other non-current liabilities\" and a reduction of deferred tax assets which is classified as \"Other non-current assets\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $327 million and $227 million, respectively, of which $188 million and $155 million, respectively, if recognized, would favorably impact the Company\\'s effective tax rate. The aggregate changes in the Company\\'s total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are summarized as follows:\\n\\n|  | As of December 31, |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |  |\\n|  |  | (in thousands) |  |  |\\n| Balance at the beginning of the year | $ 226,977 $ |  | 202,557 $ | 140,124 |\\n| Increases related to tax positions taken during the current period | 65,630 |  | 26,865 | 35,317 |\\n| Increases related to tax positions taken during prior periods | 76,794 |  | — | 27,116 |\\n| Decreases related to tax positions taken during prior periods | (10,117) |  | (2,445) | — |\\n| Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities | (32,179) |  | — | — |\\n| Decreases related to expiration of statute of limitations | — |  | — | — |\\n| Balance at the end of the year | $ 327,105 $ |  | 226,977 $ | 202,557 |\\n\\nThe Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes and in \"Other non-current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $25 million, $2 million, and less than $1 million, respectively, of interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes. The amount of interest and penalties accrued at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $28 million and $3 million, respectively.\\n\\nThe Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for years 2016 through 2018 and is subject to examination for 2019 through 2022. The foreign and state tax returns for years 2016 through 2022 are subject to examination by various state and foreign jurisdictions. While the Company is in various stages of inquiry and examination with certain taxing authorities and we believe that our tax positions will more likely than not be sustained, it is nonetheless possible that future obligations related to these matters could arise. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from an examination.\\n\\nGiven the potential outcome of current examinations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months. However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made at this time.\\n\\n#### 11. ',\n",
       " 'Employee Benefit Plan',\n",
       " \"\\n\\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 80% of their annual salary through payroll deductions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at the discretion of the Board. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company's matching contributions totaled $114 million, $102 million and $85 million, respectively.\\n\\n### *Multiemployer Benefit Plans*\\n\\nThe Company contributes to various multiemployer defined pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our unionrepresented employees. The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from single-employer plans such that (i) contributions made by the Company to the multiemployer pension plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in the multiemployer pension plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan; and (iii) if a company stops contributing to the multiemployer pension plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may become the obligation of the remaining participating employers. The Company also contributes to various other multiemployer benefit plans that provide health and welfare benefits to both active and retired participants. The Company does not participate in any multiemployer benefit plans that are individually significant to the Company.\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contributions to multiemployer pension and health plans for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively:\\n\\n|  |  |  | Year Ended December 31, |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | 2023 |  | 2022 |  |  | 2021 |\\n|  |  |  | (in thousands) |  |  |  |\\n| Pension benefits | $ | 57,285 | $ | 127,885 | $ | 111,133 |\\n| Health benefits |  | 85,157 |  | 96,285 |  | 83,153 |\\n| Total contributions | $ | 142,442 | $ | 224,170 | $ | 194,286 |\\n\\n#### 12. \",\n",

       " '\\n\\nThe Compensation Committee (the \"Committee\") of the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of Netflix, Inc. (the \"Company\") believes that it is appropriate for the Company to adopt this Clawback Policy (the \"Policy\") to be applied to the Executive Officers of the Company and adopts this Policy to be effective as of the Effective Date.\\n\\n### 1. ',\n",
       " 'Definitions',\n",
       " '\\n\\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:\\n\\n- a) \"Company Group\" means the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable.\\n- b) \"Covered Compensation\" means any Incentive-Based Compensation granted, vested or paid to a person who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for the Incentive-Based Compensation and that was Received (i) on or after the effective date of the applicable Nasdaq listing standards, (ii) after the person became an Executive Officer and (iii) at a time that the Company had a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association.\\n- c) \"Effective Date\" means October 27, 2023.\\n- d) \"Erroneously Awarded Compensation\" means the amount of Covered Compensation granted, vested or paid to a person during the fiscal period when the applicable Financial Reporting Measure relating to such Covered Compensation was attained that exceeds the amount of Covered Compensation that otherwise would have been granted, vested or paid to the person had such amount been determined based on the applicable Restatement, computed without regard to any taxes paid (i.e., on a pre-tax basis). For Covered Compensation based on stock price or total stockholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in a Restatement, the Committee will determine the amount of such Covered Compensation that constitutes Erroneously Awarded Compensation, if any, based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the stock price or total stockholder return upon which the Covered Compensation was granted, vested or paid and the Committee shall maintain documentation of such determination and provide such documentation to the Nasdaq.\\n- e) \"Exchange Act\" means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\\n- f) \"Executive Officer\" means each \"officer\" of the Company as defined under Rule 16a-1(f) under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, which shall be deemed to include any individuals identified by the Company as executive officers pursuant to Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. Both current and former Executive Officers are subject to the Policy in accordance with its terms.\\n\\n- g) \"Financial Reporting Measure\" means (i) any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company\\'s financial statements, and any measures derived wholly or in part from such measures and may consist of GAAP or non-GAAP financial measures (as defined under Regulation G of the Exchange Act and Item 10 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act), (ii) stock price or (iii) total stockholder return. Financial Reporting Measures may or may not be filed with the SEC and may be presented outside the Company\\'s financial statements.\\n- h) \"Incentive-Based Compensation\" means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\\n- i) \"Lookback Period\" means the three completed fiscal years (plus any transition period of less than nine months that is within or immediately following the three completed fiscal years and that results from a change in the Company\\'s fiscal year) immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare a Restatement for a given reporting period, with such date being the earlier of: (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Restatement, or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a Restatement. Recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation under the Policy is not dependent on if or when the Restatement is actually filed.\\n- j) \"Nasdaq\" means the Nasdaq Stock Market.\\n- k) \"Received\": Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed \"Received\" in the Company\\'s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in or otherwise relating to the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the grant, vesting or payment of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\\n- l) \"Restatement\" means a required accounting restatement of any Company financial statement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including (i) to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (commonly referred to as a \"Big R\" restatement) or (ii) to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is not material to the previously issued financial statements but that would result in a material misstatement if the error was corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (commonly referred to as a \"little r\" restatement). Changes to the Company\\'s financial statements that do not represent error corrections under the then-current relevant accounting standards will not constitute Restatements. Recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation under the Policy is not dependent on fraud or misconduct by any person in connection with the Restatement.\\n- m) \"SEC\" means the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\\n\\n- n) \"Subsidiary\" means any domestic or foreign corporation, partnership, association, joint stock company, joint venture, trust or unincorporated organization \"affiliated\" with the Company, that is, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, \"controlling\", \"controlled by\" or \"under common control with\", the Company. \"Control\" for this purpose means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, contract or otherwise.\\n### 2.

The Committee must pursue (and shall not have the discretion to waive) the forfeiture and/or repayment of such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with Section 3 of this Policy, except as provided below.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee (or, if at any time the Committee is not a committee of the Board responsible for the Company's executive compensation decisions and composed entirely of independent directors, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board) may determine not to pursue the forfeiture and/or recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation from any person if the Committee determines that such forfeiture and/or recovery would be impracticable due to any of the following circumstances: (i) the direct expense paid to a third party (for example, reasonable legal expenses and consulting fees) to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered (following reasonable attempts by one or more members of the Company Group to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the documentation of such attempts, and the provision of such documentation to the Nasdaq), or (ii) recovery would likely cause any otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\\n\\n### 3. \",\n",

The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS, before a single arbitrator and held in the county and state in which the Executive Officer who is a party to such arbitration resides as of the Effective Date (or such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties to such arbitration), in accordance with the then-current JAMS Employment Rules & Procedures (the \"Rules\") and the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 *et seq.*) (\"FAA\"), as modified by the terms and conditions contained in this Section 4. A copy of the Rules are available online at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration/english. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, then in accordance with the Rules.\\n\\nTo the extent permitted by Section 5 hereof, the Company Group will pay the arbitrator\\'s fees and arbitration expenses and any other costs unique to the arbitration hearing (recognizing that each side bears its own deposition, witness, expert and attorney\\'s fees and other expenses to the same extent as if the matter were being heard in court). In addition, to the extent permitted by Section 5 hereof, if any party prevails on a statutory claim that affords the prevailing party attorneys\\' fees and costs, then the arbitrator may award reasonable attorneys\\' fees and costs to the prevailing party. Any dispute as to who is a prevailing party and/or the reasonableness of any fee or costs shall be resolved by the arbitrator.\\n\\nThis Section 4 and any arbitration shall be governed by the FAA to the exclusion of any state law inconsistent with the FAA. The arbitrator shall apply the substantive state or federal law as applicable to the claim(s) asserted in arbitration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing in this Policy shall be interpreted to preclude filing of a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or any similar federal, state or local administrative agency.\\n\\n### 5.

For this purpose, \"indemnification\" includes any modification to current compensation arrangements or other means that would amount to *de facto* indemnification (for example, providing the person a new cash award which would be cancelled to effect the recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation). In no event shall any member of the Company Group be required to award any person an additional payment if any Restatement would result in a higher incentive compensation payment.\\n\\n### 6. ',\n",

To the extent that any provision of this Policy is found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be applied to the maximum extent permitted and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Policy shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Policy. Recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy is not dependent upon the Company Group satisfying any conditions in this Policy, including any requirements to provide applicable documentation to the Nasdaq.\\n\\nThe rights of the members of the Company Group under this Policy to seek forfeiture or reimbursement are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights of recoupment, or remedies or rights other than recoupment, that may be available to any member of the Company Group pursuant to the terms of any law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement or any other policy, plan or agreement of any member of the Company Group.\\n\\n### 7.
